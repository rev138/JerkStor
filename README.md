JerkStor
========

JerkStōr aims to be a secure, RESTful blob store backed by MongoDB. 

I've chosen this as a project to help teach myself Java/Spring. My original intent was to create
a free Dropbox replacement for my own personal use, but since I've discovered how fully featured
ownCloud is, I've scaled back my designs. Presently, my goal is to integrate JerkStōr as a
pluggable back-end for ownCloud, but that will have to be part of a "teach myself php" project in
the near future.

This is still very much a work-in-progress. Feel free to contact me with questions.
